#summary Overview of the project.

= Introduction =

This project was started as a prototype for a presentation given at Penguicon 5.0 (April 20-22, 2007) on Animation using Draw2D and Eclipse.  It is the result of one person's effort in her spare time over the course of two days.  So please don't expect a Flash killer.  However, if you're really curious, you can download the binary or source code and take a peek at what it can do.  Enjoy!

I'm not sure how much more time I'll spend on this project, but please feel free to post suggestions using the Issues tracker - or perhaps, if you're so inclined, contribute to the project.  Who knows, given enough monkeys, we might be able to create something useful.
